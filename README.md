# California Housing Pricing Prediction Project

Using 9 different machine learning methods to predict the california housing data which is collected from various sources including Zillow website and Fred Economics data. Assessed the performance of best model from previous models using bootstrap. The final model is using forward stepwise algorithm with OSR2 99.98% and RMSE 0.0056. 

Code: PPPP.R.

# Design and Prototype tools for IP Strategy data analysis
Manipulated large-scaled dataset that contains over 40 years of patent data and hundreds of millions of observations. Forecasted time-series data using ML and DL models such as ARIMA, LSTM in Python. Improved the accuracy of prediction for individual CPC data from 81% to 94%.
